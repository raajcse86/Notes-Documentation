Kubernetes:
Orchestration of containers(computer system, middleware and services)
we will define the manifest file, describe the container,describe the replica, restoring in case of crash.
Load balancer
hard drive
security config - all these thing would be handled by kubernetes.
it can run on any cloud provider.
It originated by google, now managed by cloud native computing federation company.(almost 200 companies) - 

Docker Swarm:
	it has its own orchestration system.

Adv of Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm:
		Docker Swarm - built in , simpler. - u have to do it manually ,it is not that sohisticated.
		Kubernetes is bigger - far richer, hard to learn - take these manifest file and deploy to different cloud platform without changing manifest file.
		
Installing Minikube for local kubernetes development:
			install hypervisor
			install kubectl
			install minikube
			
kubectl:
				controller program for kubernetes

virtual box:
					u can install manually for VM.
hyper V:
			it comes with inbuilt. just u can enable -after enabling this should not use oracle virtual box - it would be horrible.

To Start Minikube on Window 10 Professional edition:
minikube start --vm-driver="hyperv" --hyperv-virtual-switch="switch"						
kubelet
kubeade

set HTTP_PROXY=http://10.212.192.234:8080
set HTTPS_PROXY=https://10.212.192.234:8080

setx http_proxy http://"rajasekar.murugesan:Raj$250417"@10.212.192.234:8080
setx https_proxy http://"rajasekar.murugesan:Raj$250417"@10.212.192.234:8080


Docker:
enable us to create container. These containers are complete, u can deploy directly to server.
container contains all the dependency. - just pass the container and then u can run on any computer.

To uninstall:
open  ey toolbox>machine>tools>avecto programs utility     

--env HTTP_PROXY="http://'rajasekar.murugesan:Raj$250417'@10.212.192.234:8080"




If you are struck try running: - this is temporary fix.
minikube start --bootsrapper=localkube                  

it can even crash while using
minikube stop -- stoping local kubernetes cluster

minikube delete - remove vm from vm manager

then again you can start
minikube start


What is Kubernetes and Why?
	system for running different containers over multiple different machines(may be vm or physical machines)

minikube start --vm-driver hyperv --hyperv-virtual-switch "Primary Virtual Switch"
