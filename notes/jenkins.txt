Hi Pranab,

we are done with the free or trial version of PCF. The paid version of PCF that is for 2GB it is 86$/month for 2 instance + GST
I am not sure whether Nivedita is using the application or not. We have written separate services for register and for candidate details, if needed
we can collate it as a single service.May be if we really want to make use of the application we can put all of them as a single
java instance and then we can deploy it on any of the web hosting services like GoDaddy etc.

I have analysed about web hosting services and domain name services ,the details are below.
