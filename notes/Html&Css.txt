History of Internet:
			Darpa (Defence Advnaced Research Organization)in 1969 -in internet they sent the word log- then system crashed
			packet switching - send the info in packets and retreived.
www - came in 90s
			www is aservice runs on that hardware - (fibre under ocean)
			Tim berner lee - father of www	
			in 1990 - created http, browser and web server and html to create document.
				scientist , reasearchers sends the document like this without any order or beautifications etc
				Browser - takes html and renders

w3C - consortium, ppl from standard organization like Google, Yahoo etc
IETF - helps the growth of internet (Internet Engineering Task Force)			

codepen.io
		where u can write html,css and js
		https://emmet.io/ - it is a plugin  for many text editors which helps to write the code so easily.
		emmet cheat sheet. - give you lot of shortcut to write the code.
		Ex: ! and tab - give you the structure of the html
Other tools:
			Atom
			Web storm
				these also work with emmet
Separation of concerns:
				html -structure
				css - formatting
				js - functionality
Semantic html:	
					put a valida tag instead of just div.
					<body>
						<header></header>
						
						<section></section>
						<footer></footer>
				</body>
					
css rule set:
	selctor = element selector
		.css
		header{
			width:100
			hieght:100
		
		}
	this will select all the elements with this tag name in the html	
Linking css to Html:
		MEthod 1:
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css"/>
		Method 2:
			<style>
				header{
				
				}
			</style>		
			
		Method 3:
			<header style="width:100%"/>  -- least prefered - difficult to read, update, maintain.
Method 1 is always recommended.

Multiple css selectors:
			.css

			*{
				margin:50px
			}	
		selects all the elements in the html element.
		
IDE for html css and javascript
		Webstorm - it is paid - it is so good.
		Atom - it is free
		Sublime
		DreamWeaver	
	Atom:
		install emmet packages by going to settings.
		install atom-html-preview
Git hub terminal essentials:		
	Create a local repo and remote repo
	create a folder 
	git init - this will make that folder as a repo in the local.
	git status
	git add <Name of the file> or
	git add --all
	git commit -m 'message to commit'
	git log
	
	Creaet a Remote repo by logging in the browser ,then push this local branch changes from local to remote.
	git remote add origin https://github.com/raajcse86/test-repo.git
	git push -u origin master
	or even we can give git push directly from second time
	
Using Emmet
		ol>li*10+tab
			it creates ordered list of 10 li.
		ul>li*10+tab
			it creates unordered list of li
		child:
		div>p
		siblings:
		div+p
		form#header.tile - This creates <form id="header" class="title"/>	
		
css:
			div{
  width:300px;
  height:100px;
  background-color: yellow;
  margin: 10px;
  border-radius: 200%;
  border:1px solid blue;

}


.happy{
  color:red;
  margin-left: 20px;
  margin-right: auto;
  margin-top: 200px;
  border: 0.1px solid orangered;

}
