It is similar to TDD

BDD is next step of Test Driven Development
Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a collaborative process where the Product Owner, developers, and testers cooperate to deliver software that brings value to the business.


Principles of BDD
	Define a test set for the unit first;
	Make the tests fail;
	Then implement the unit;
	Finally verify that the implementation of the unit makes the tests succeed.


	
BDD focus on 	
It is largely facilitated through the use of a simple domain-specific language (DSL) using natural language constructs (e.g., English-like sentences) that can express the behavior and the expected outcomes.
These DSLs convert structured natural language statements into executable tests. 
These statements are nothing but the acceptance criteria for a given function and tests used to validate that functionality

How it Works?
It is not just any requirements, executable ones! 
You write scenarios in a format that can be run against the software to ascertain whether the software behaves as desired.


Example:
Given the ATM has $250
And my balance is $200
When I withdraw $150
Then the ATM has $100
And my balance is $50
